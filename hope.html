        <h1> Geography of the Earth </h1>
        <p> The geography of Earth is vast and diverse, encompassing continents, oceans, mountains, plains, deserts, and <br>
         forests. Earth is divided into seven continents Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and<br>
         Australia each with its own unique landscapes and climates. Additionally, the planet is surrounded by five major <br>
         oceans the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic which play a crucial role in regulating global climate and<br>
         supporting marine life.<br>
         One of the most fascinating aspects of Earth's geography is its varied landforms. Mountains such as the <br>
         Himalayas and the Andes are formed by tectonic movements, while plains and valleys are shaped by erosion and<br>
         deposition. Deserts like the Sahara experience extreme heat and dryness, whereas rainforests like the Amazon <br>
         receive abundant rainfall and support diverse ecosystems. The physical geography of different regions influences <br>
         climate, wildlife, and human activities.<br>
         Earth's climate is classified into different zones, including tropical, temperate, and polar regions. These zones <br>
         are determined by latitude, altitude, and proximity to water bodies. Tropical regions near the equator experience warm <br>
         temperatures and heavy rainfall, while temperate regions have moderate climates with distinct seasons. Polar regions, <br>
         such as Antarctica and the Arctic, remain cold throughout the year due to their location near the Earth's poles.<br>
         Another essential aspect of geography is the distribution of natural resources. Forests provide oxygen and raw <br>
         materials, rivers supply freshwater, and mineral deposits fuel industries and economies. However, human activities, <br>
         such as deforestation, mining, and pollution, have led to environmental challenges like climate change and habitat <br>
         destruction. Sustainable resource management is crucial to maintaining a healthy balance between human development <br>
         and environmental conservation.<br>
         In conclusion, Earth's geography is a dynamic system that influences all aspects of life. From towering mountains <br>
         to vast oceans, from hot deserts to freezing polar regions, every part of the planet plays a role in shaping climate, <br>
         ecosystems, and human civilization. Understanding geography helps us appreciate the planet's beauty, adapt to natural <br>
         changes, and work toward a sustainable future.<br>

        <h1> Layers of Earth </h1>
        <p> 1. Oceanic Crust<br>
         The oceanic crust is the thinner, denser part of Earth's outermost layer, primarily made of basalt. It forms<br>
          the ocean floor and is constantly recycled through tectonic activity. Compared to the continental crust, it is <br>
           younger because it is continuously created at mid ocean ridges and destroyed in subduction zones.<br>
         2. Continental Crust<br>
         The continental crust is thicker and less dense than oceanic crust, mainly composed of granite. It forms the<br>
          landmasses where humans and other life exist. Unlike oceanic crust, it is much older, with some parts dating back<br>
           billions of years. The crust, both oceanic and continental, is a crucial part of the lithosphere.<br>
         3. Lithosphere<br>
         The lithosphere includes the crust and the rigid uppermost part of the mantle. It is divided into tectonic plates<br>
          that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere below. The movement of these plates leads to geological activities such <br>
          as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain formation.<br>
         4. Asthenosphere<br>
         Beneath the lithosphere, the asthenosphere is a semi-fluid layer of the mantle where rocks are partially molten.<br>
          This layer plays a key role in plate tectonics by allowing the rigid lithosphere to move. The slow convection currents<br>
           in the asthenosphere drive the motion of Earth's tectonic plates.<br>
         5. Upper Mantle<br>
         The upper mantle extends from the asthenosphere down to about 660 km beneath Earth's surface. It is composed of <br> 
         solid rock but behaves plastically over long periods due to intense heat and pressure. This layer helps transfer heat<br> 
         from Earth's interior towards the surface.<br>
         6. Lower Mantle<br>
         The lower mantle extends from around 660 km to 2,900 km deep. It is hotter and more rigid than the upper mantle<br>
         due to the immense pressure. The material here moves very slowly but still contributes to mantle convection, which affects<br>
         surface processes such as volcanic activity.<br>
         7. Outer Core<br>
         The outer core is a liquid layer made mostly of iron and nickel, extending from 2,900 km to 5,150 km beneath the<br>
          surface. Its movement generates Earth's magnetic field, which protects the planet from harmful solar radiation. This<br>
           layer is responsible for phenomena like the aurora borealis (Northern Lights).<br>
         8. Inner Core<br>
         At the very center of the Earth lies the inner core, a solid sphere composed of iron and nickel. Despite reaching<br>
         temperatures of up to 5,500°C (9,932°F), it remains solid due to the extreme pressure surrounding it. The inner core<br>
         is essential for Earth's geodynamo system, which helps maintain the planets magnetic field.<br>
